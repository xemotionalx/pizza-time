# pizza-time
a full stack application for eating pizzas

## About the App
Pizza Time! is a fullstack app that uses MYql and Express to allow the user to order and eat pizzas. It utilizes "GET" "POST" and "PUT" API routes. The user enters the type of pizza they want, which is then saved to the database. The information persists even after the pizzas are "devoured".

## Try it out!
Visit this app here: https://vast-cliffs-45097.herokuapp.com/ 

After you load the homepage, you can enter the type of pizza you want, then click "submit".

You can then devour all the pizzas you want!

A future improvement to this app would be to store more complex orders and have options besides "devour" to modify the data.
